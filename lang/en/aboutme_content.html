                        Let me explain how it started: Whereas I was a little girl, my dad given me his <i>"Minolta"</i> ... and the passion was born.

                        Wildlife parks and natural reserves have become over time a perfect terrain for training, and to discover a multitude of colors, movements and incredible scenery. <strong>Much more than a job, it's a passion!</strong>

                        The nature is also a growing source of inspiration: Tell me, who has never stopped in front of a beautiful sunset ? <strong>For me it is a stolen moment, on the edge of the nightlife, which offers a magical show ...</strong>

                        At night, there are the lights of the night , the shadows ... and everything takes a new face. It is quite disturbing, isn't it?

                        <p>
                        If one day this scenes will not inspire myself and invite me to capture the moment, there will be time for me to find a new passion. <strong>Until then, Welcome into my world ...</strong>
